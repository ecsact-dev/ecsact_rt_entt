# EnTT ecsact runtime and utilities

:warning: **In heavy development** :warning:

NOTE: This repository is being moved to https://github.com/ecsact-dev soon. Once that happens an open source license will be added to the repository.

This repository contains an ecsact runtime implementation using the fabulous library EnTT. There are also several utilities that are useful to some when using ecsact and EnTT together.
